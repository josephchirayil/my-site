# Introduction

Space travel is a very ambitious and intriguing topic in today's modern civilization. Large companies and administrations 
such as NASA and SpaceX are this day testing and planning new projects which involve humans going to the Moon and other
planets such as Mars. This article will provide a solid overview on this topic.

# How Space Travel Could Benefit Us

Humans and our use of Planet Earth are directly the main cause of climate change. Climate change has worsened badly, especially
within the last 200 years. Unfortunately, this incites humans to explore other planets that we could possibly habituate from the
inevitability of climate change. As of now, our top candidate is Mars, which humans could go to within the next 30 years. Say, if
humans are able to decelerate or even stop climate change, space travel could still benefit us, such as providing us resources from 
other planets.

# Conclusion

Overall, space travel is a topic that humanity is not far from knowing, and it has the potential to lead us to a safe haven after
climate change takes over or even can provide us with extra non-renewable resources.
